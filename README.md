# Personal Pixel Art Canvas

Welcome! üëã This is a free tool that transforms your large Aseprite projects into a high-performance website, allowing you to view your art conveniently on any device.

This project works like a "smart map": it slices your huge canvas into thousands of small pieces and loads only the ones visible on the screen. This allows you to display artwork of any size without lag.
